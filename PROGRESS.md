```

### Architecture & data flows

```
1. Workflow Builder (design time)

   NodePalette (drag from left)
        │ drag & drop
        ▼
   Canvas (React Flow) ─── node click ───> NodeConfigPanel (right)
        │                                        │
        │ save (ctrl+S / button)                  │ apply config
        ▼                                        ▼
   BuilderClient.handleSave() ── PUT /api/.../workflows/[id] ──> DB (new WorkflowVersion + nodes + edges)

2. Trigger Run (runtime)

   TriggerButton "Run Now"
        │ POST /api/.../trigger
        ▼
   WorkflowRun created (status: queued)
        │ workflowQueue.add("execute", { runId })
        ▼
   BullMQ (Upstash Redis) ──> Worker picks up job

3. Worker Execution (BullMQ Worker, concurrency 5)

   Worker receives job ──> loads run + events from DB
        │
        ▼
   Topological sort (Kahn's algorithm)
        │
        ▼
   Condition evaluation ──> active node set (follows matching edges)
        │
        ▼
   For each active node (in DAG order):
     ├── already succeeded? → skip
     ├── delay node? → first time: create "delayed" event + queue.add({ delay })
     │                   delayed job fires → mark success + continue
     ├── execute node → success? → create event, continue
     │                  fail + retries left? → create failed event, retry in-process
     └── fail + no retries? → dead_letter status, stop
        │
        ▼
   All nodes done → status: completed

4. Execution Visualization

   RunSelector dropdown → select a run
        │
        ▼
   Map<nodeId, RunNodeStatus> passed to Canvas
        │
        ▼
   Canvas applies _runStatus to each node's data
        │
        ▼
   Custom nodes render status borders:
     success → green ring    running → blue pulsing    delayed → amber dashed
     failed  → red ring      pending → 50% opacity
```

### Database changes (Phase 3 additions)

| Model | New Column | Type | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| WorkflowNode | `label` | `String?` | Custom node name (survives save/load) |
| WorkflowEdge | `sourceHandle` | `String?` | "true"/"false" for condition branching |

### Dependencies added

- `@xyflow/react` ^12.10.2 — React Flow canvas library (drag-and-drop node editor, minimap, controls, custom nodes)
- `turbo` ^2.9.12 — Monorepo task runner (updated from v1 to v2, migrated `pipeline` → `tasks`)

---

## Database Connection

- **Host:** Supabase PostgreSQL (aws-1-ap-southeast-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432)
- **Schema:** `opsflow`
- **Connection string:** In `packages/db/.env` via `DIRECT_URL`
- **ORM:** Prisma 6 (v6.19.3)

### Useful commands

```bash
pnpm dev                           # Start all apps (web + worker)
pnpm seed                          # Reset and seed demo data
pnpm --filter @opsflow/db push     # Push schema to DB
pnpm --filter @opsflow/db generate # Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm build                         # Build all packages
```

## Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Seed user can now login** — `alice@example.com` with strong random password (set during Phase 5).
2. **BullMQ integrated** — Worker consumes queue from Upstash Redis with 5x concurrency. Trigger is `queue.add()`. Delay nodes use BullMQ's built-in `delay` option.
3. **`packages/core` and `packages/ui`** are empty shells for future work.
4. **No tests** — zero test files across the entire project.
5. **Webhook/cron triggers** not implemented — only manual "Run Now" trigger available.
6. **GitHub push** — Works via GitHub Desktop (GFW blocks CLI `git push`). Vercel CLI for manual deploy if needed.
7. **BullMQ runtime error** — Worker deploys on Railway but throws `client[commandNameWithVersion] is not a function`. Root cause under investigation (likely BullMQ/ioredis internal method resolution issue).

## Phase 4 — AI Layer ✅

### What was built

| Module | Files | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI Infrastructure (DeepSeek client) | `lib/ai.ts`, `lib/prompts.ts` | Done |
| AI Node Suggestions | `api/.../ai/suggest-nodes/route.ts`, `components/.../ai-suggestions-panel.tsx` | Done |
| NL Workflow Generation | `api/.../ai/generate-workflow/route.ts`, `components/.../ai-workflow-generator.tsx` | Done |
| Lead Scoring | `api/.../ai/score-lead/route.ts`, `components/leads/ai-insights-card.tsx` | Done |
| Anomaly Detection | `api/.../ai/analyze-run/route.ts`, `run-view.tsx` (updated) | Done |

### Key features

- **Zero architecture change** — all AI runs in existing API Routes via DeepSeek API
- **4 new API endpoints** — suggest-nodes, generate-workflow, score-lead, analyze-run
- **Builder AI panel** — left sidebar collapsible panel, "Add to Canvas" for each suggestion
- **NL → Workflow** — type description → full workflow graph loads on canvas
- **Lead scoring** — per-row "Score" button + "Score All" batch + detail page AI Insights card
- **Anomaly analysis** — "Analyze with AI" button on failed runs, shows root cause + fix

## Phase 5 — Internal Ops ✅

### What was built

| Module | Files | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Org Settings (name/slug editor) | `settings/page.tsx`, `settings-general.tsx` | Done |
| Members Management (CRUD + roles) | `settings/members/*`, `api/members/*` | Done |
| Org Switcher (multi-org navigation) | `sidebar-header.tsx`, `api/orgs/[slug]/switch` | Done |
| Global Runs Panel (filter + retry + cancel) | `runs/page.tsx`, `api/runs/*` | Done |
| Audit Log Viewer (paginated log viewer) | `audit-log/page.tsx`, `api/audit-log` | Done |
| Worker Visibility (health card on dashboard) | `worker-status-card.tsx`, `api/worker/health` | Done |
| Sidebar Navigation (3 new nav items) | `sidebar.tsx` (updated) | Done |

### Key features

- **Full admin suite** — org settings, member CRUD, role management, audit log — no DB access needed
- **Operations tooling** — global runs view with status filter, retry failed runs, cancel stuck runs
- **Org switching** — multi-org users switch orgs from sidebar, JWT re-signed on each switch
- **Worker monitoring** — real-time worker health on dashboard (last poll time, queue sizes)
- **Last-owner protection** — API prevents demoting/removing the last owner of an org
- **Sidebar expanded** — from 3 to 6 nav items (Dashboard, Leads, Workflows, Runs, Settings, Audit Log)

## Senior Signals Improvements

| Signal | Status | Implementation |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Typed API Contracts | ✅ | `lib/api-types.ts` — all request/response interfaces |
| Cache Invalidation + Optimistic Updates | ✅ | TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) — `useQuery`/`useMutation` in leads + runs + audit log |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ | middleware.ts — per-IP sliding window (100 req/min), 429 response |
| Feature Flags | ✅ | `lib/feature-flags.ts` — env-based toggles for all AI features |
| Structured Logging | ✅ | `lib/logger.ts` — JSON logging in auth routes + AI API routes |
| Advanced Table Sorting | ✅ | Clickable column headers on leads table (Name/Email/Stage/Created) |
| Empty/Error/Loading States | ✅ | All pages patched — explicit error UI with Retry buttons |
| Real-time Updates | ✅ | SSE endpoint + `useRealtimeRuns` hook replacing 3s polling in run-view |
| Multi-tenant Isolation | ✅ | All 16 API routes scope queries by `organizationId` |
| Async Job Queue (BullMQ) | ✅ | Upstash Redis + BullMQ Worker with 5x concurrency, delay node via re-queue |

## Phase 6 — Deployment 🔄

> Started: 2026-05-13  
> Updated: 2026-05-14 (worker health fix)

### Deployment targets

| Component | Platform | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Web App (Next.js) | Vercel | ✅ Deployed & working |
| Worker (BullMQ) | Railway | 🔧 Deployed, BullMQ runtime error |
| Database (PostgreSQL) | Supabase | ✅ Already hosted |
| Redis | Upstash | ✅ Already hosted |

**Production URL:** `opsflow-ai-omega.vercel.app`

### Vercel deployment fixes (lessons learned)

| Fix | File | Reason |
|-----|------|--------|
| **`.npmrc` with `node-linker=hoisted`** | `.npmrc` | **KEY FIX**: pnpm virtual store deep paths prevented Vercel from tracing Prisma engine `.so.node` files |
| **`binaryTargets`** | `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` | `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` + `native` targets for Vercel + local |
| **`experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages`** | `apps/web/next.config.js` | Next.js 14.2 correct key (NOT `serverExternalPackages`) |
| **Postinstall generate** | `package.json` | Prisma Client with workspace schema |
| **`vercel.json` build config** | `apps/web/vercel.json` | `prisma generate` → `next build` |
| **Split bcrypt from auth** | `lib/password.ts`, `lib/auth.ts` | bcryptjs (Node.js) separated from Edge JWT code |
| **Pass org slug as prop** | `worker-status-card.tsx`, `page.tsx` | Client components must receive orgSlug from server, NOT extract from URL (root `/` path yields `undefined` → fallback `demo-org` doesn't exist in production) |

### Bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|-----|------------|-----|
| 1 | Login returns 500 | Prisma engine not found on Vercel | `.npmrc` + `binaryTargets` + `serverComponentsExternalPackages` |
| 2 | New leads saved with NULL fields | `onMutate` cleared form fields before mutation executed | Moved cleanup to `onSuccess` |
| 3 | Settings Save "No valid fields" | Save enabled with no changes — empty body sent | Disable button when no fields changed |
| 4 | Dialog Select dropdown clipped | `overflow-hidden` on Dialog content | Changed to `overflow-visible` |
| 5 | `audit.ts` TS type error | `AuditLogCreateInput` requires relation, code uses scalar `organizationId` | Changed to `AuditLogUncheckedCreateInput` |
| 6 | Railway build fails (CLI postinstall) | `@railway/cli` postinstall downloads from GitHub, blocked by GFW | Removed `@railway/cli` from dependencies |
| 7 | Railway start command wrong path | `cd apps/worker &&` not effective in nixpacks | Changed to full path: `npx tsx apps/worker/src/index.ts` |
| 8 | Railway healthcheck fails (no HTTP) | Worker had no HTTP server | Added healthcheck HTTP server in worker index.ts |
| 9 | Worker health API 404 on Vercel | Route read local `.worker-health.json` file | Changed to DB-based health queries |
| 10 | Worker health frontend crash | Simplified debug route didn't return expected `{worker, queue}` format | Restored full DB-based response |
| 11 | Worker health API STILL 404 after DB fix | `WorkerStatusCard` extracted org slug from `window.location.pathname` — at root path `/` this always fell back to `"demo-org"`, which doesn't exist in production (users have custom slugs like `alice-workspace` from registration) | Pass `orgSlug` as prop from server component; add `force-dynamic` + try-catch in route handler |

### Railway deployment fixes (ongoing)

| Fix | File | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Root `start` script** | `package.json` | `"start": "npx tsx apps/worker/src/index.ts"` for nixpacks auto-detection |
| **HTTP healthcheck server** | `apps/worker/src/index.ts` | Static `node:http` import, binds `0.0.0.0:PORT`, responds to Railway probes |
| **Queue simplification** | `apps/worker/src/queue.ts` | Replaced Proxy-based lazy connection with direct `new Redis()` + `new Queue()` |
| **Release config** | `railway.toml` | Builder: nixpacks, Build: `pnpm install && prisma generate`, Start: full path |

### Current blocker

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | BullMQ `client[commandNameWithVersion] is not a function` | 🔧 Worker deploys, healthcheck passes, but job processing fails. Likely BullMQ/ioredis internal method resolution (not version-dependent — persists across ioredis 5.3.2 and 5.10.1) |

### Remaining issues

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | BullMQ runtime error on Railway | 🔧 Under investigation |
| 2 | Demo data not seeded on production DB | ⬜ |
| 3 | `REDIS_URL` not set on Vercel (needed for trigger/retry) | ⬜ |
| 4 | Page navigation feels slow (1-2s) | 🔧 No `loading.tsx` — could add skeleton states |
| 5 | No tests | ⬜ Zero test files |
| 6 | `useWorkflowRun.ts` hooks hardcodes `demo-org` | ⬜ Unused file, but should be fixed if ever used |

### Next steps

1. **Deploy worker health fix**: `npx vercel --prod --cwd apps/web` (user will push via GitHub Desktop first)
2. Fix BullMQ `client[commandNameWithVersion]` error on Railway
3. End-to-end verification (login → create workflow → trigger run → SSE streaming)
4. Seed demo data on production DB
5. Add `REDIS_URL` to Vercel env vars
6. Add `loading.tsx` skeleton states
